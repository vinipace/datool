# Shopify customer journey actions

Implementation checklist for PR #36. The reference is [Chatbase's native Shopify actions](https://www.chatbase.co/docs/user-guides/chatbot/actions/shopify-actions), checked 23 October 2026. A checked implementation item is not evidence that a production store has granted its permissions.

## Delivery checklist

- [x] Bind customer authorization to authenticated channel messages and recheck identity before each action.
- [ ] Product discovery, variant IDs, stock filtering and product cards with cart controls.
- [ ] Read and update the shopper's storefront cart; retain chat state during navigation.
- [ ] Online checkout, cash on delivery and free orders, with merchant-selected payment policies.
- [x] Own order history, status and tracking; guest lookup by order number and checkout email or phone.
- [x] Merchant-allowlisted order tags.
- [x] Account activation and sign-in guidance appropriate to the store's account system.
- [x] Update the authenticated customer's profile and default account address.
- [ ] Returns/refunds and exchanges on the existing order within merchant policy.
- [ ] Replacement orders with mandatory human approval and original-order credit accounting.
- [ ] Action settings, confirmations, error states and reusable chat controls.
- [ ] Required/optional scope configuration, protected customer data approval and reconnect guidance.
- [ ] Behavioral authorization, policy, idempotency and UI tests; Shopify schema validation.
- [ ] Update this PR and verify a controlled sandbox install after release.

## Authorization and execution contract

The model must never choose the authenticated customer. Shopify's signed app proxy identifies the customer; a server-only record binds the admitted message to the browser identity version. Runtime actions resolve that record through their durable channel job and turn. Logout, account switching, connection revocation, a different store, and missing authentication fail closed. Public message metadata is not an authorization source.

Guest order proofs grant access to one matching order, not a customer account. Responses omit unrelated personal data. Mutations validate ownership immediately before dispatch, enforce merchant settings on the server, and use the existing durable tool ledger. An ambiguous external write is never automatically replayed. Approval resumes use the pinned original action and input, not a visitor-supplied approval flag.

Cart operations execute against the current storefront session using a bounded, origin-checked bridge. Shopify calculates prices, discounts, shipping, taxes and payment status. A checkout URL is not a completed or paid order. Updating an account address does not change a placed order's delivery address.

Existing abuse protections remain burst-oriented. This work does not add default daily message quotas or spending caps.

## Release gates

Public apps require Shopify approval for protected customer/order data. Access to orders older than 60 days additionally requires `read_all_orders` approval. Added permissions require merchant consent. Development-store validation, merged code, production deployment, permission grants and end-to-end verification are separate checks.

## Verification recorded so far

The first implementation slice has six behavioral tests covering message-bound identity, account changes, tag policies, guest order proofs, account activation and one-shot customer confirmation. The confirmation regression fails on the prior runtime because it dispatches the change before consent. Seven Chromium story tests cover the confirmation and integration controls. Order/customer GraphQL operations validate against Shopify 2026-10. These are local checks; production still needs the new release and customer/order permissions.
